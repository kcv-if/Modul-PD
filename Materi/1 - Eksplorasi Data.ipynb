    "    In this example, the Gensim library is used to train a Word2Vec model on a small dataset of text documents. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, and cosine similarity is then used to measure the similarity between the word vectors of two words ('data' and 'mining').\n",

    "    Capturing hidden semantics often involves leveraging advanced techniques such as word embeddings, neural networks, or deep learning models. These methods are particularly useful in applications like natural language processing, recommendation systems, and image analysis where capturing the underlying meaning or semantics is crucial."
